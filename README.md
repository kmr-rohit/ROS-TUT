# ROS-TUT
The main purpose for this project to make you familiar with working on 2 wheeled robot 
using ros gazebo..

 initially you have to setup folders directory.
You can make folders as your wish but I suggest you to do as 
mine so that we can keep up with upcoming changes.

FOR DUAL BOOT INDIVIDUALS :
1. Create a folder named ROS-TUT (ROS - tutorial) in home and enter the same.
2. Create a folder named 2wheeledbot inside ROS-TUT.
3. Create a folder named simulation-ws ( workspace for simulating  bot) inside 2wheeledbot
4.
